###### Quine McCluskey and Petrick Method
> A simple python implementation of the Tabular Quine McCluskey's Algorithm to
minimize karnaugh maps made by Ian Achio and Jaron Cascante

##### Folder Structure:
- `main.py` : Initialize the program
- `solverKarg.py`: It has a class with all our logic necessesary to minimize the maps
- `file1.txt` : Example of the files you need to put on the root folder to minimize functions!

### Algorithm
