###### Quine McCluskey and Petrick Method
> A Python implementation of the Tabular Quine McCluskey's method and Petrick to
minimize karnaugh maps of boolean functions made by Ian Achio and Jaron Cascante

######## Folder Structure:
- `main.py` : Initialize the program
- `solverKarg.py`: It has a class with all our logic necessesary to minimize the maps
- `file1.txt` : Example of the files you need to put on the root folder to minimize functions!

###### NOTE: pla.py is buggy
The C++ implementaion is more readable and slightly more optimized.

### Algorithm
